            <div>
                <p>
                    Our specialty is working with business teams to arrive at the behaviors expected of its members and
                    then
                    measuring their achievement of those behaviors. We use the World Cafe process to guide the team to
                    arrive
                    at and define their behaviors. Then the software for teams collects data to measure achievement of
                    those
                    behaviors. We have designed and documented the product <em>Teams Get It</em>. This project is ready
                    for a support
                    consortium
                    to

            <div>
                <p>
                    The “field” of business culture is so broad that it is nearly impossible for a company to be aware
                    of
                    the
                    many possible practices. We have designed and documented an interactive system for companies to
                    document
                    their existing culture practices and then share them with all employees. The system also shows what
                    other
                    practices and tools a company might consider. This project is ready for a support consortium to be
                    assembled. <a href="#">Click here for more details</a>.

        <div class="content">
            <p>
                A few months ago, I thought about company culture being like a family vegetable garden. Both need
                nurturing, cultivation, fertilizer, sunshine, water and the plants that will produce the desired
                result.
                Then I had the good fortune to be introduced to Dr. Irv Rubin. He liked the idea. Now he and I and a
                few
                guest authors are writing chapters for a book to be called “A Company Culture Gardeners Guide”. We will
                publish them one chapter at a time. When finished we’ll put them into a book. If you would like to
                suggest
                a chapter that you would like to write, let Jerry know. Or maybe you know someone that would like to.
                The
                introductory chapter here introduces “Company Culture Gardens”.

                our
                poet laureate. He will publish a different poem for us at the beginning of each month.
