        <h2>Workplace Team Behaviors</h2>
        <p>
            Our specialty is working with business teams to arrive at the behaviors expected of its members and
            then
            measuring their achievement of those behaviors. We use the World Cafe process to guide the team to
            arrive
            at and define their behaviors. Then the software for teams collects data to measure achievement of
            those
            behaviors. We have designed and documented the product. This project is ready for a support consortium
            to
            be assembled.

        <h2>Document Company Culture Practices</h2>
        <p>
            The “field” of business culture is so broad that it is nearly impossible for a company to be aware of
            the
            many possible practices. We have designed and documented an interactive system for companies to
            document
            their existing culture practices and then share them with all employees. The system also shows what
            other
            practices and tools a company might consider. This project is ready for a support consortium to be
            assembled.

        <p>

            positive workplace cultures. The interactive format with all participants including the speakers is

            home

        <h2>City Chapters</h2>
        <p>
            The Academy has chapters in Omaha, NE, Kansas City, MO, Dallas, TX and Denver, CO.  Chapters arrange
            2-4
            local meetings per year with speakers.  Each Chapter has a President with a leadership team.   The
            purpose
            of the chapters is education that promotes practices for positive workplace cultures. We have a <a href="docs/newchaptermodel.pdf">
                set of
                guidelines
            </a> for starting new chapters. Its purpose is to make it simpler to start new chapters.

        <h2>Company Culture Gardening</h2>
        <p>
            A few months ago, I thought about company culture being like a family vegetable garden. Both need
            nurturing, cultivation, fertilizer, sunshine, water and the plants that will produce the desired result.
            Then I had the good fortune to be introduced to Dr. Irv Rubin. He liked the idea. Now he and I and a few
            guest authors are writing chapters for a book to be called “A Company Culture Gardeners Guide”. We will
            publish them one chapter at a time. When finished we’ll put them into a book. If you would like to suggest
            a chapter that you would like to write, let Jerry know. Or maybe you know someone that would like to. The
            introductory chapter here introduces “Company Culture Gardens”.

        <h2>Art</h2>
        <p>
            Culture is art and science. We honor art including poetry from our special friend Stewart Levine who is our
            poet laureate. He will publish a different poem for us at the beginning of each month.
