      <p>
        The Academy of Culture Ambassadors is a group of like-minded individuals working to accelerate the growth of
        kindness and purpose in workplaces. We recognize that the human factor is of the utmost importance in all
        organizations—without people, they don’t work!.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Academy is a non-profit corporation. This designation underscores our commitment to providing services for
        the benefit of the public. Our purpose, “To accelerate the growth of kindness and purpose in workplaces,” is
        good for everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        A uniqueness for the Academy is that we design, develop, and market Culture Support Software that provides for
        our financial sustainability.
      </p>
      <p>
        This image captures the essence of what the Academy does and what follows in this web site is an elaboration
        upon that.

      <p>
        Academy teams are organized within the Academy for specific purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Chapters Team:</strong> Chapters are groups in cities. Chapters have been similar in structure to
        Chapters in
        professional associations such as SHRM. However, a Chapter may wish to not follow that format. A Chapter can
        form an assemblage with a few friends that decide what to do and how to do it so long as it supports the
        Academy’s purpose.

      </p>
      <p>
        An example of a Chapter is in Omaha, Nebraska. Click their logo to see what they do and how they do it.

            alt=""></a>
      </p>
      <p>Teams are being formed within the Academy that are a mix of employees, volunteers, donors, and customers. Each
        team is a Self-Managed. Simply put, that means the team agrees upon a task(s), each person is accountable, and
        there is open and honest communication. The purpose of each team is to be a brain trust to the Academy for
        creative ideas and solutions. As teams are formed, they will be shown here along with purpose and photos of
        team members. A usual communication format is for a team to have a Zoom meeting every 6-8 weeks with email in
        between. It is fun!.

          <p>We believe as Howard Schultz the head of Starbucks says: “The currency of leadership is transparency”.</p>

          <p>The Academy has designed software that gives all employees ultra-transparency to data that affect their
            wellbeing in
            their company culture. That ranges from rating achievement of agreed upon company culture practices to
            employee
            conversations about the company’s plans for the future. Nothing is anonymous and all employees are invited
            to
            participate. The software is exceptionally easy to use and nearly anything can be shared with all
            employees. The
            project is ready for Pay Forward Development Partners as described in the Product Development section. <a

            The Academy has designed software for business teams to arrive at the behaviors expected of its members and
            then measuring their achievement of those behaviors. We call the software Teams Get It&copy;. <a

          <h3>Our Ideas&copy; Software</h3>
          <p>
            The Academy has designed software for employees to offer ideas for achieving the wellbeing culture they
            wish
            for. When ideas reach a threshold of employee likes, they are emailed to a designated management group.
            Their
            responses are captured and are available for employee review. This project is ready for a Pay Forward
            Development
            group.

          <hr>

          <h3>Pay Forward Product Development</h3>
          <p>
            The Academy has Pay Forward Software Partner's in classes as Platinum, Gold, and Silver. They receive
            this
            acknowledgment when their donations are accumulated for and applied to the initial development of a
            specific piece
            of software. The Academy posts on their web site when such donations are open for that status and for what
            product.
            The minimum donation for Platinum is $7,500, for Gold is $5,000, and for Silver is $3000. All such
            donations are
            tax deductible. If a company is interested in paying the full development cost for a specific product, they
            will be
            informed about the amount of money needed. PFSP donations are held in escrow until enough has been
            accumulated to
            pay for a given product development. Each PFSP has the same usage rights of all software users that accept
            the
            Academy’s open source agreement.

            <strong>STUCK</strong><br /><br />
            Our gears get bogged down<br />
            Caught in a vortex leaving a frown<br />
            Needing movement up down left right<br />
            Hard to get unglued stuck in fright<br />
             <br />
            Longing resolution drives what we do<br />
            Our voice of vision makes music too<br />
            Indecision serves in a way<br />
            Included in the price we pay<br />
             <br />
            Repeating voice clogs the mind<br />
            Time energy a challenge to find <br />
            Present pain not strong enough<br />
            In limbo till it gets too tough<br />
             <br />
            What answer caught in this vice<br />
            What action turns things nice<br />
            What single step begins return<br />
            What movement cools the burn<br />
             <br />
            For this challenging place of heart<br />
            Quiet voices make peace with your art<br />
            Let silence teach as you learn<br />
            Trust responses honor the yearn<br />
             <br />
            You have answers and what to do<br />
            Inner guidance carries you through<br />
            Careful knee jerk reactions and moves<br />
            Follow the wisdom of your grooves <br />
             <br />
            How do you process the dissonance <br />
            when feeling stuck? What voices do <br />
            you listen to and how do you decide <br />
            which to follow?

        are the characteristics of these two powerhouse generations in the workplace? How do their values shape – and
        impact – organizational culture? Come listen and have a casual conversation about creating a positive culture
        that works for ALL generations, and capitalizes on the best each has to offer. Your bottom line will thank you.
