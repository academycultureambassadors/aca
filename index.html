    <div class="content">
      <p>
        The Academy of Culture Ambassadors is a group of like-minded individuals working to accelerate the growth of
        kindness and purpose in workplaces. We recognize that the human factor is of the utmost importance in all
        organizations—without people, they don’t work!.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Academy is a non-profit corporation. This designation underscores our commitment to providing services for
        the benefit of the public. Our purpose, “To accelerate the growth of kindness and purpose in workplaces,” is
        good for everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        A uniqueness for the Academy is that we design, develop, and market Culture Support Software that provides for
        our financial sustainability.
      </p>
      <p>
        This image captures the essence of what the Academy does and what follows in this web site is an elaboration
        upon that.

        Academy teams are organized within the Academy for specific purposes. They are within the Academy in contrast
        to Affiliates described in the next section.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Chapters Team:</strong> Chapters are groups in cities. Chapters have been similar in structure to
        Chapters in
        professional associations such as SHRM. However, a Chapter may wish to not follow that format. A Chapter can
        form an assemblage with a few friends that decide what to do and how to do it so long as it supports the
        Academy’s purpose.

      </p>
      <p>
        An example of a Chapter is in Omaha, Nebraska. Click their logo to see what they do and how they do it.

        <img src="img/aca-logo-denver.png" style="width: 200px" alt="">
      </p>
      <p>Teams are being formed within the Academy that are a mix of employees, volunteers, donors, and customers. Each
        team is a Self-Managed. Simply put, that means the team agrees upon a task(s), each person is accountable, and
        there is open and honest communication. The purpose of each team is to be a brain trust to the Academy for
        creative ideas and solutions. As teams are formed, they will be shown here along with purpose and photos of
        team members. A usual communication format is for a team to have a Zoom meeting every 6-8 weeks with email in
        between. It is fun!.

            Gift giving a reason to live<br />
            Give freely don't hold back<br />
            Know you're on the right track<br />
            <br />
            Giving comes back many fold<br />
            Reward consolation growing old<br />
            Meanwhile feeling good each day<br />
            Knowingly earning daily pay<br />
            <br />
            Belonging and sense of pride<br />
            Know you’re on the right side<br />
            Others see you guiding the way<br />
            Revealing self your holy way<br />
            <br />
            Not money recognition fame<br />
            Not ego or your good name<br />
            Giving sharing your own soul<br />
            Making others grow more whole<br />
