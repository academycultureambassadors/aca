            The Academy has developed a 6-step process for companies to document
            and gather their culture practices all in one place. We call the
            system “Our Culture Story”. The results are (1) a printed booklet
            with a company’s culture practices (2) an online e-booklet with the
            same contents and (3) online computer software with the booklet data
            where employees can add more content such as their experiences,
            thoughts, beliefs, and opinions for each culture practice. This
            additional content is available only for employees and is not in the
            public booklet. We would love to explain this more fully in a short
            Zoom meeting.

            One of our specialites is working with business teams to arrive at
            the behaviors expected of its members and then measuring their
            achievement of those behaviors. We use the World Cafe process to
            guide the team to arrive at and define their behaviors. Then the
            software for teams collects data to measure achievement of those
            behaviors. We have designed and documented the product
            <em>Teams Get It&copy;</em>. This project is ready for a support
            consortium to be assembled.

          A few months ago, I thought about company culture being like a family
          vegetable garden. Both need nurturing, cultivation, fertilizer,
          sunshine, water and the plants that will produce the desired result.
          Then I had the good fortune to be introduced to Dr. Irv Rubin. He
          liked the idea. Now he and I and a few guest authors are writing
          chapters for a book to be called “A Company Culture Gardeners Guide”.
          We will publish them one chapter at a time. When finished we’ll put
          them into a book. If you would like to suggest a chapter that you
          would like to write, let Jerry know. Or maybe you know someone that
          would like to. The introductory chapter here introduces “Company
          Culture Gardens”.

          Culture is art and science. We honor art including poetry from our
          special friend Stewart Levine who is our poet laureate. He will
          publish a different poem for us at the beginning of each month.

          <strong>EFFORT</strong><br /><br />
          Great satisfaction digging deep<br />
          Expending effort falling asleep<br />
          Healthy empty when spent<br />
          Satisfied where energy went<br />
          <br />
          Whatever pulls you to give<br />
          Gift giving a reason to live<br />
          Give freely don't hold back<br />
          Know you're on the right track<br />
          <br />
          Giving comes back many fold<br />
          Reward consolation growing old<br />
          Meanwhile feeling good each day<br />
          Knowingly earning daily pay<br />
          <br />
          Belonging and sense of pride<br />
          Know you’re on the right side<br />
          Others see you guiding the way<br />
          Revealing self your holy way<br />
          <br />
          Not money recognition fame<br />
          Not ego or your good name<br />
          Giving sharing your own soul<br />
          Making others grow more whole<br />
          <br />
          What is your gift that provides value to others? <br />
          Are you clear about this best work and giving freely?
