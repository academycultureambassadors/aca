        <strong>Academy City Chapters</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The Academy of Culture Ambassadors has City Chapters in <a href="#" class="open-overlay"
          opens="#chapter-omaha">Omaha</a>, <a href="#" class="open-overlay" opens="#chapter-denver">Denver</a> and
        Kansas
        City. They
        hold amazing local meetings using a format similar to that of traditional association chapters, i.e., organized
        meetings with featured speakers.
      </p>
      <p>
        This model will continue for those interested and may or may not include the following get-togethers option.
        Vice versa, get-together groups may form separate from a local city chapter if there is no local city chapter.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Local Get-Togethers</strong></p>
      <p>The get-together model is similar to that of the time-honored book clubs. It combines learning, social time,
        and networking all rolled into one. Groups meet at coffee shops, lunch cafes, wine and cheese bars, someone’s
        home, or someone’s office.  Simple, easy, fun, and no cost. No arranging of speakers, AV equipment, finding a
        place to meet, and food.</p>

        <div class="content">
          <p>
            Those attending a discussion time will have reviewed a timely culture article, book, or video that is the
            discussion topic for a meeting.
          </p>
          <p>
            The get- togethers are organic. The mix of people attending a certain group might change from time to time.
            More
            groups spin off from existing groups.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each group has a volunteer facilitator that chooses place, time and topic to be discussed. The National
            Academy
            can suggest topics and materials if wanted. The national Academy takes care of meeting announcements and
            handles
            reservations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The format for meetings is not fixed. But a typical format is for 4-6 people which accommodates typical cafe
            table sizes. Each meeting lasts about one hour.
          </p>

        Software named Transparency Console(c) is being developed. The software allows transparency of business data for
        employees which is essential for employee engagement, retention, innovation, and wellbeing. The interface and
        its content are designed, created and maintained by employees with no IT background. Each console will be
        created from scratch and the console at every company will be different. Shown here is a mockup of a possible
        console. When a cell image is double clicked, the contents are opened for employee viewing and interaction. We

        The Academy thinks of company culture being like a family vegetable garden. Both need nurturing, cultivation,
        fertilizer, sunshine, water and the plants that will produce the desired result. The Academy is publishing
        chapters for what will become a book called “Company Culture Gardening”. We will publish them one chapter at a
        time. When finished we’ll put them into a book.

            <strong>STUCK</strong><br /><br />
            Our gears get bogged down<br />
            Caught in a vortex leaving a frown<br />
            Needing movement up down left right<br />
            Hard to get unglued stuck in fright<br />
             <br />
            Longing resolution drives what we do<br />
            Our voice of vision makes music too<br />
            Indecision serves in a way<br />
            Included in the price we pay<br />
             <br />
            Repeating voice clogs the mind<br />
            Time energy a challenge to find <br />
            Present pain not strong enough<br />
            In limbo till it gets too tough<br />
             <br />
            What answer caught in this vice<br />
            What action turns things nice<br />
            What single step begins return<br />
            What movement cools the burn<br />
             <br />
            For this challenging place of heart<br />
            Quiet voices make peace with your art<br />
            Let silence teach as you learn<br />
            Trust responses honor the yearn<br />
             <br />
            You have answers and what to do<br />
            Inner guidance carries you through<br />
            Careful knee jerk reactions and moves<br />
            Follow the wisdom of your grooves <br />
             <br />
            How do you process the dissonance <br />
            when feeling stuck? What voices do <br />
            you listen to and how do you decide <br />
            which to follow?

        are the characteristics of these two powerhouse generations in the workplace? How do their values shape – and
        impact – organizational culture? Come listen and have a casual conversation about creating a positive culture
        that works for ALL generations, and capitalizes on the best each has to offer. Your bottom line will thank you.
